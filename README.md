# PrimeFlix

On PrimeFlix website, any user can view all the movies but to watch them, the user needs
to login. There can be two types of users, one can simply be a viewer or can be an admin who
uploads latest TV shows and movies:

1. Viewer: The viewer will be first viewing our home page. From there they can search
or click on any category or they can just view any movie/TV show individually. From
here they can watch or download the movie. Here the details about the movie are also
given and along with that the user can like/ dislike or can add/ remove the movie from their
watch later section. Also, add recommended movies/ TV shows will be listed below.

2. Admin: An admin has all the privileges a viewer has, but they can also update, delete
or post new movies/ TV shows.
